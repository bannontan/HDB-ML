# HDB-ML #

## Purpose of this project ##
The purpose of this project was to explore and reinforce the concepts I learned regardinng Machine Learning. I wanted to apply the concepts to real-world problems and see how far I could go doing a project on my own rather than in a team.

I explored using different models to fit the data and utilized different metrics to test the models created.

## Data ##

The data were downloaded from Kaggle for HDB housing prices accross various towns from in Singapore 1990-2020. 
In an attempt to account for inflation, I used the Consumer-Price-Index(CPI) so that the prices will be standardized. This facilitated a more comprehensive comparisons between resale prices over the years.

HDB_ML.ipynb file contains the step by step breakdown of the code and metrics used.
